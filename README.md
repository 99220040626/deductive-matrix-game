Deductive Matrix Puzzle – Corporate Assessment Simulation

This project is a web-based logical reasoning application designed to simulate corporate aptitude test environments such as Cognizant and Capgemini assessments.

The application dynamically generates 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 matrix grids where:

Each row must contain unique numbers (1 to N)

Each column must contain unique numbers (1 to N)

The user enters values and one “?” symbol

The system computes the correct missing value using a backtracking algorithm

🔹 Key Features

Dynamic matrix size selection (3×3, 4×4, 5×5)

Full backtracking-based logical deduction engine

Professional responsive UI design

Real-time puzzle solving

Single “?” replacement logic

Deployed as a live web application

🔹 Technologies Used
