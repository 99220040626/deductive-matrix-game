🧠 Deductive Matrix Puzzle – Corporate Assessment Simulation

🌐 Live Application:
https://99220040626.github.io/deductive-matrix-game/

📌 Overview

Deductive Matrix Puzzle is an interactive web-based logical reasoning simulator inspired by corporate aptitude assessments conducted by companies such as Cognizant and Capgemini.

The application recreates matrix-based analytical challenges designed to evaluate:

Logical deduction

Pattern recognition

Constraint satisfaction

Problem-solving under structured rules

It provides a realistic simulation of technical screening environments used in corporate hiring processes.

🎯 Problem Logic

The system dynamically generates N × N matrix grids (3×3, 4×4, 5×5) with the following constraints:

Each row must contain unique numbers from 1 to N

Each column must contain unique numbers from 1 to N

The user inputs values with exactly one missing element marked as "?"

The application computes the correct missing value using a backtracking constraint-solving algorithm

This mirrors constraint satisfaction problems similar to simplified Sudoku logic.

⚙️ Core Features

✔ Dynamic grid size selection (3×3, 4×4, 5×5)
✔ Constraint-based logical validation
✔ Optimized backtracking deduction engine
✔ Real-time puzzle solving
✔ Single-missing-value intelligent resolution
✔ Clean, responsive, professional UI
✔ Deployed as a live web application

🏗️ Technical Architecture

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript

Algorithmic Logic:

Recursive backtracking

Constraint validation

Row and column uniqueness enforcement

Deployment:

GitHub Pages

Netlify (alternative deployment ready)

🧠 Algorithm Design

The application uses a backtracking algorithm that:

Validates row uniqueness

Validates column uniqueness

Recursively explores valid number placements

Backtracks when a constraint violation occurs

Determines the correct value for the missing cell

This ensures accurate logical deduction rather than hardcoded pattern matching.

🚀 Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates:

Strong understanding of algorithmic problem-solving

Practical implementation of constraint satisfaction logic

Clean UI development without frameworks

Deployment and production readiness
